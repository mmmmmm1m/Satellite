# Satellite
This program is a simple program that can calculate how fast a satellite must move at a certain distance from a planet with a certain mass.
It can also calculate the distance using the velocity.
It can calculate geosynchronous (same as geostationary if it's along the equator) orbit of a satellite.
This can be used for any planet because the user can input a custom mass for the planet.
This program is assuming that the satellite is moving outside the atmosphere.
When the user selects Earth, there is a chance that the program might be slightly inacurrate with certain satellite trajectories because
the program uses the radius of Earth at the equator.
It can also find the apoapsis and periapsis of a satellite with an elliptical orbit.
